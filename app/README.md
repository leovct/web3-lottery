# Lottery Web App

This Next.js project contains the Lottery web app and tests (if I have enough time to write them during the hackathon). The app interacts with the blockchain using rainbow-kit and the Alchemy provider as well as integration with Vercel to deploy a version at each commit.

## Getting Started

```
$ npm install
$ mv .env.example .env.local // fill in the requested values
```

## Run the app locally
```
$ npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
